# Experiments with Swift
This is a folder that will contain all applications I made with Swift and have stored
each application in their corresponding experiment folder.

Swift is a commonly used programming langauge to help develop mobile applications 
(or mobile apps), and I will intend to record all my findings from these experiments in 
their own Markdown files.

XCode is typically the IDE to use to build mobile applications with Swift, but 
I'm using a Windows 11 device where XCode is not available. Therefore, I will 
also record my findings on finding and using an alternative to XCode in order to 
build mobile applications with Swift.
